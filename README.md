<b>SURVANT-Cryp REDUCE Toolkit</b> (Map no longer available)

A collection of harm reduction resources (maps, guides, websites, and educational materials) specifically tailored to the residents of Park Slope Women's Shelter in Brooklyn, New York.<br>

The main objective of the toolkit is to help connect people—especially the women I work with at Park Slope Women's Shelter—to harm reduction services and therapies in New York City. I am the Assistant Recreation Coordinator at PSWS. My favorite activity I organize at the shelter is the open art studio, where clients can speak freely and make any kind of art they like. Here are two of my favorite <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/h28qkeoacqowcke/AABpX8mjHec8-C5v5tRRHzT0a?dl=0">paintings</a> from the group, both done by Ms. Ann. The toolkit developed out of informal conversations during this daily activity. The groups and organizations listed in the toolkit utilize practical strategies and ideas aimed at reducing the negative consequences associated with substance use and unprotected sexual activity. Resources for victims of domestic and sexual violence are also included.<br>

Most of us can only imagine the survival stratagems developed by people living on the periphery of mainstream society. Individuals who have been historically excluded from institutions of knowledge production can offer unique, relevant, and critically important contributions to our understanding of the contemporary world—thanks in large part to their different lived experiences. With that said, I hope this tool will help people experiencing homelessness locate and access the resources they require to reduce harm. I believe increased access to resources will allow these individuals to have greater input into the creation of programs and policies designed to fight homelessness, substance abuse, and domestic violence.

The SURVANT-Cryp REDUCE Toolkit was inspired by the Transborder Immigrant Tool (TBT), a mobile technology project by Electronic Disturbance Theater that provides immigrants crossing the U.S./Mexico border with safe routes and directions to water caches throughout the desert.<br>

I am sharing this project on GitHub in the spirit of distribution and DIWO culture.<br>
